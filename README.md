1️⃣ Rent vs Buy Cost Comparison
- Homeownership costs are consistently higher than renting due to mortgage, property taxes, and maintenance costs.
- Renters save an average of $1700-1900 per month compared to homeowners (varies by location and market trends).

2️⃣ Investment Returns – What If Renters Invest Their Savings?
If renters invest their monthly savings instead of buying:
  - If the renter was able to invest $1000 of the difference per month for 10 years at 7%, it could yield $174,000.
  - Buying only becomes advantageous if home appreciation outpaces investment returns.

3️⃣ Trend Analysis – How Has Rent vs Buy Changed Over Time?
- Historical data shows home prices have increased 43.6% over the last ten years.
- Rent has increased at a slower rate compared to home prices.
- In recent years, higher interest rates have made homeownership less affordable.

4️⃣ Future Cost Forecasting (Next 12 Months)
Advanced ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest) predict:
  - Rent will slightly decrease by 1.4% over the next year.
  - Homeownership costs will rise due to increasing mortgage rates and taxes.
  - The rent vs buy gap is expected to widen, making renting more favorable in the short term.

Methodologies Used:

Data Analysis & Cleaning: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning Models: XGBoost, Random Forest
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV to optimize model performance
Visualization: Matplotlib & Interactive Plotly Dashboards
Forecasting: ML models predict rent and homeownership costs over the next 12 months

Conclusion:
📌 Renting is currently the more cost-effective option in most markets due to high home prices and mortgage rates.
📌 Investing monthly rent savings can outperform homeownership wealth accumulation in many cases.
📌 Buying may only be favorable if home prices appreciate significantly faster than investment returns.
📌 Future predictions suggest that renting will remain advantageous in the short term.
