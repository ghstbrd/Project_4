1️⃣ Rent vs Buy Cost Comparison
- Homeownership costs are consistently higher than renting due to mortgage, property taxes, and maintenance costs.
- Renters save an average of $X per month compared to homeowners (varies by location and market trends).
- The financial break-even point (where buying becomes cheaper) often takes X years.

2️⃣ Investment Returns – What If Renters Invest Their Savings?
If renters invest their monthly savings instead of buying:
  - Assuming an average 7% annual return on investments, renters accumulate $X over 10 years.
  - Buying only becomes advantageous if home appreciation outpaces investment returns.

3️⃣ Trend Analysis – How Has Rent vs Buy Changed Over Time?
- Historical data shows home prices have increased by X% over the last Y years.
- Rent has increased at a slower rate (X% per year) compared to home prices.
- In recent years, higher interest rates have made homeownership less affordable.

4️⃣ Future Cost Forecasting (Next 12 Months)
Advanced ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest) predict:
  - Rent will increase by X% over the next year.
  - Homeownership costs will rise due to increasing mortgage rates and taxes.
  - The rent vs buy gap is expected to widen, making renting more favorable in the short term.

Methodologies Used:

Data Analysis & Cleaning: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning Models: XGBoost, Random Forest
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV to optimize model performance
Visualization: Matplotlib & Interactive Plotly Dashboards
Forecasting: ML models predict rent and homeownership costs over the next 12 months

Conclusion:
📌 Renting is currently the more cost-effective option in most markets due to high home prices and mortgage rates.
📌 Investing monthly rent savings can outperform homeownership wealth accumulation in many cases.
📌 Buying may only be favorable if home prices appreciate significantly faster than investment returns.
📌 Future predictions suggest that renting will remain advantageous in the short term.
